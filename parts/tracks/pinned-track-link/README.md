# Plastic Meccano pinned track pieces

Useful if material a bit brittle or as the joining link.

The star clip is push fit on the end of the posts and can be pulled off again. 
The posts are in a block so they do not fall over while printing. The title says twin but actually 8!
The link is shown with its supports. They break off easily and quite cleanly.
