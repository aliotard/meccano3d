A collection of &frac12;" cubes.

The [cube with holes](cube-with-holes.stl) is designed so that a bolt can be
screwed into each face to tap the holes.  If plain axle holes are required, the
holes should be drilled to size.

The [cube with nuts](cube-with-nuts.stl) is designed to have nuts inserted into
each face and fixed in place using a cyanoacrylate glue.
