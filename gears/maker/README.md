# Meccano gear maker

Create Meccano compatible gears from 19 to 133 teeth, to fit round or triflat axles, with or without a boss.

First time setup: edit the OpenSCAD file and change the dxf_path variable to match the directory where you unzipped the DXF files.

Making a gear: edit the parametric values in the source to create the gear you want, render the model, export it to an STL file, slice and print. Repeat as required.

I make no claims to be an OpenSCAD expert. This is primarly an attempt to get the ball rolling by making some Meccano related OpenSCAD stuff available. Some folk might glean some insight from it; conversely someone might tell me all the things I've done wrong and I might learn something from it! Either way, it's a win.

As is usual with open source code, no warranty is expressed or implied.
